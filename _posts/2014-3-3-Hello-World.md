Prompt: What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?


Response:  I think that being a data scientist is about being able to utilize statistics and computer science to discuss and create representations of data for clients.  The most important duty of a data scientist is being able to transform data into meaningful conclusions that can be used to make decisions.  Data scientists must be knowledgeable enough in their area to be able to make inferences about the data they are seeing so they can explain what the data means in laymen's terms to those who don't know statistics as well.  They should also have a strong grasp of computer science in order to create programs that can take data and transform it into something meaningful for thier clients.  

As a statistics student, I have always associated statistics as involving computer science to an extent.  Perhaps it is simply because of the current demand for data scientists that statistics programs have begun including more programming intensive courses.  I see myself as being stronger in the area of statistics, but I know that it is becoming more and more necessary to have some programming skills in order to succeed as a statistician in industry settings.  I have been focussing more on improving my coding skills over the last year, so hopefully I will see the payoff from that!

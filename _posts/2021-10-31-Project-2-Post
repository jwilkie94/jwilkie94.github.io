Project 2 was designed to perform analyses on online news data subsetted by data type.  EDA was performed on each subset of data and four linear and ensemble models were fit against the data.  The data were split into a test and training set for model creation.  Once chosen, each model was then compared based on RMSE value to find the best model for predicting the data.

**What would you do differently?**

Something that I always struggle with in programming assignments is overthinking my code and making a lot of unnecessary changes that lead to confusion.  
I would try to focus on breaking the project into smaller, more manageable parts next time, to keep myself from getting overwhelmed and overthinking everything. 


**what was the most difficult part for you?**

It's difficult working virtually with a partner, so next time, I think we will implement Zoom or some other platform more.  
Trying to communicate primarily with email leads to a lot of confusion and stress.


**what are your big take-aways from this project?**

I struggled with automation on previous assignments, but I think I was finally able to get a handle on it with this project.  I still have more to learn, but I definitely have a better understanding than before. 
I'm also still struggling with choosing linear models to test, so that is something that I need to spend more time working on in the future.  
Overall, I enjoyed this assignment and thought it was an interesting look into the possibilities of data analysis using R markdown.

**What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?**  

In my first blog post, I said that data scientists take raw information and transform it into meaningful data that can be used to make decisions. I still believe that that is a major component of data science.  One thing that I have realized during this class is just how important the way you present your data is.  Not everyone approaches information with a statistical or data centric mindset, so it is very important to make sure that data is presented in a way that makes it easy to observe trends and recognize the significance of the results.  


**What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**  

I have really enjoyed learning to use R.  Prior to this class, I had been primarily using SAS and I have started to prefer R.  I will definitely continue using it after this class.  Because there are so many ways to do things in R, it made it a little confusing at first, but now that I have had more time to work with it, I find it extrememly useful.  R markdown is an incredibly helpful tool for presenting statistical data and I plan on using it frequently.  

**What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**

As the course progressed, I realized how helpful it was for me to sketch out my code on paper before attempting to do anything in R.  It made it easier for me to take a look at what I was trying to accomplish logically, then translate that into the appropriate code.  Going forward, I am going to continue using this approach whenever possible.  It makes the coding process much easier for me.  I am also going to take some time to look into the Shiny app more.  There are so many things that can be done with Shiny and Shiny Dashboard and I want to learn more about them.
